Within Delivery you can view your previously Sent and Scheduled Messages. Here you can view individual message stats and export shown messages to csv.

You can sort this list by "Source" like all messages sent through the Dashboard, API, or Automated and even sort by "Device Type" like Android vs iOS vs Web browsers. Advanced Filtering allows you to filter by a time period and content.

### Delivery Status
Delivery status gives you feedback on whether the message was successfully delivered to the Google, Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla, etc. servers or is in the process of being delivered or whether there were problems during delivery.

#### SMS

OneSignal provides two categories of SMS delivery statistics for more transparency and a better understanding of where the SMS is in the delivery pipeline.

**OneSignal Delivery Statistics:** (OneSignal to Twilio)
This includes 
  * total number of messages you tried to send from OneSignal
  * number of messages successfully sent from OneSignal to Twilio
  * messages that failed to be delivered to Twilio or Twilio rejected those messages for reasons that might include incorrect phone number format, unsubscribed phone number, etc.
  * remaining or still in the queue on OneSignal

**Twilio Delivery Statistics: ** (Twilio to End-User )
A message can be in the following states once OneSignal successfully delivers messages to Twilio.
  * Delivered: Twilio received confirmation from the carrier that the message has been delivered.
  * Failed Undelivered: Twilio sent these SMS but the message could not be delivered. 
  * Failed Errored: Twilio could not send the message because of various reasons. 
  * Remaining: Twilio has received the message request from OneSignal and these messages are queued to be sent out.

You can check the specific error details on [Twilio SMS Logs](https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/logs).

SMS doesnâ€™t have [Outcomes](doc:outcomes) data associated with it since we can not capture the opened, read, etc. states for SMS messages.

## FAQ

### What does Failed Notifications mean?

There are 2 types of Failed Notifications.

####1. Failed (Unsubscribed)

This means the device has unsubscribed from receiving push notifications. 

For **Web Push** this can happen when the user has cleared their browser cookies or has opted-out of notifications from the browser settings.

For **Mobile Apps** this can happen when a subscribed device has either uninstalled your application or opted-out of notifications from the device settings.

For Android Mobile apps and Web, a device must receive at least two notifications to be detected as Failed (Unsubscribed). The first notification will appear to have been successfully delivered. The device must be turned on and have a network connection to silently reject this first notification. 

After this, future notifications will then return as Failed (Unsubscribed) .

Once a device has been detected as unsubscribed, it will be marked as unsubscribed and future notifications will not be sent to it unless it re-subscribes to notifications again.

Example:

- Notification 1 sent and user receives on device, then user unsubscribes.
- Notification 2 sent, the OneSignal Dashboard shows "Delivered" but the user does not actually receive it.
- Notification 3 sent, the OneSignal Dashboard shows Failed (Unsubscribed)
- Notification 4 will not be sent to that device.
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "warning",
  "title": "iOS Unsubscribe Detection",
  "body": "Apple changed the way it reports unsubscribe events on iOS apps.\n\nIn the past, they would report the unsubscribed device upon the 2nd notification. They stopped doing this for privacy reasons. Apple intentionally does not want token invalidation to be used as a method to detect app uninstall.\n\nSome details provided by Apple can be found here: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/116445\n\nCurrently if a device unsubscribes and opens the app, we detect this right away through our SDK. However if the device uninstalls the app or unsubscribes and does not open the app, it may take several weeks for Apple to report the device unsubscribe event.\n\nIf you need to remove older devices, you can [delete them using our dashboard](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/delete-users) or you can use the API Delete Call."
}
[/block]
####2. Failed (Error)

**Web Push** - Failed (Error) generally happens when you change one of the following:
- the domain of your site or adding the same domain to another app ID
- the notification data exceeds 4kb
- there was a temporary issue with the Google Servers

**Mobile Apps** -  Failed (Error) means the FCM sender id on Android or the Bundle ID on iOS have changed from what these devices originally subscribed under. You will need to put the original version to what the users subscribed under to fix this.

Please contact [support@onesignal.com](emailto:support@onesignal.com) with your OneSignal App ID and all the major changes you made to your site.

### How do you handle suppressions like blocks, spam reports, etc?

Because OneSignal is just acting as a relay to your email service provider, we rely on the email service provider to handle communications with email servers to determine if emails are working. When an email is no longer considered working, it is **suppressed** by the email service provider, and will no longer send. Each email service provider has slightly different logic to determine suppressions - for instance, how many emails an email address must receive that bounce before being suppressed.

### Do users receive web push notifications when the browser isn't running?

More details in our [Browser Behavior Guide](doc:browser-behavior).

### Why do the Outcomes Stats Appear to be behind?

Currently our Outcome data is bucketed in 24 hour increments in UTC time.
ï»¿
When converting the UTC timestamp for example 2021-01-02T00:00Z to local time, it gives us 2021-01-02T16:00 in local time.

ï»¿This is truncated to 2021-01-02.

ï»¿Our dashboard shows the graphs based on your timezone, so due to this truncation it will show behind (or ahead) based on how far behind (or ahead) your timezone is.
