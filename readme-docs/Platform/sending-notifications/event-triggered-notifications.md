Sending notifications when users perform (or don't perform) certain actions is key to keeping them engaged. OneSignal provides a few options to easily get your website or mobile app setup to trigger notifications that keep your users engaged and coming back for more!

1 - Automated Messages
Tag > Segment > Automated message
Integration > Segment > Automated messages
- Push and Email, not SMS yet


2 - Create Notification API
Event occurs > Data sent a server (database) > Request sent to OneSignal Create Notification API


3 - Post Notification SDK method
Best for sending to current device, scheduleing for future.
Like a game that sends new "coins" after 12 hours
