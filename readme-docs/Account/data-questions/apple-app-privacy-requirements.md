Starting December 8, 2020, Apple will [require a privacy disclosure for all new apps and app updates](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/). You will need to respond to the app privacy questions in the App Privacy tab in [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/). Instructions from Apple can be found [here](https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/dev1b4647c5b). As OneSignal is a third-party to your app, you‚Äôll need to ensure you are properly disclosing to your users the ways you are using OneSignal in regards to their data. 

By default, OneSignal only collects certain In-App Purchase data (Consumable) and Usage Data (clicks and session duration) for iOS apps. If you set up and collect additional data through Data Tags or Outcomes will need to disclose those additional data types.

Please review the following Data Types when filling out your privacy details.

## Data Types

‚úÖ = Required when using OneSignal
üí° = May be required when using OneSignal
‚ùå = Not required when using OneSignal

*IDFA and IDFV are no longer captured by the OneSignal iOS SDK as of version 2.16.0 and 3.x.x. If you‚Äôre using an older version of the SDK prior to 2.16.0, you will need to disclose this as collected data.

## Required Data Types

### Type: Purchases

If your app has in-app purchases, you must disclose that your app collects ‚ÄòPurchases‚Äô information in your data collection response.

      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
#### 1. Purchase History

For OneSignal, at a bare minimum, you must select ‚ÄòAnalytics‚Äô. This information is used in OneSignal‚Äôs dashboard features including Segments and Outcomes.

  "body": "If you are using OneSignal for any of the other options listed or have set up additional data collection through OneSignal, you will need to select those options as well."
}
[/block]
#### 2. Purchase History Linked to Identity

Apple will now ask if you are linking purchase history data to a user‚Äôs identity. If you are using OneSignal‚Äôs anonymous app player IDs and do not have a way to identify individual users, you can select ‚ÄòNo‚Äô.

If you are using an app user ID that can be tied to a user‚Äôs email address or other contact information via your own server or other third parties, you should select ‚ÄòYes‚Äô.

    }
  ]
}
[/block]
#### 3. Purchase History for Tracking

Finally, to indicate if purchase history data will be used for tracking purposes, you will need to read Apple‚Äôs examples and determine if your app meets their definitions of tracking.

OneSignal, as a third-party, does not inherently use purchase history to track users across different apps for advertising. If you are using integrations or other SDKs that do this, you may need to disclose that here.

### Review

After making your privacy selections, Apple will show a product page preview of your app's privacy details. If you have chosen Purchases and Usage Data as described above, your privacy details should look like this:

If the way you set up and collect data changes in the future, you should return to App Store Connect to edit your responses.
