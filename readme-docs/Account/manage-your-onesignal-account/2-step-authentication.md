# What is Two-Step Authentication
Two-Step Authentication provides an additional authentication layer to ensure only you can access your OneSignal account.

In addition to your email address and password or OAuth, Two-Step Authentication requires you to install an authenticator app such as Authy on your personal mobile device. When you log in to OneSignal, you will be prompted for a verification code generated by the authenticator app to access your OneSignal account.

## Step 3. Recovery Codes
Upon successful set up of an authenticator app, OneSignal will generate a set of 10 recovery codes. These codes can be used to login to your account if you don't have access to the authenticator app.

*Note*: For security purposes, OneSignal will display the recovery code only once. Please download or copy these in a safe place. In case you lose the recovery codes, you can generate a new set, invalidating the old recovery codes, from the Account Management page.

From the Organization Roles tab, Org-level admins can:
  * View login method and two-step authentication status for all users
  * Change the organization-wide Two-Step Authentication policy to
  ** Default**: Allow users to select their own, individual login method, with or without the two-step authentication
  ** Recommended**: Require Two-Step Authentication for all users. Mandatory Two-Step Authentication at an org-level will force all users to enable two-step authentication before they can log in to OneSignal the next time.

**Note**: Org-wide policy enforcement with a single-click is only available to **paid accounts**.

## What if I am locked out of my account?

1. Email support@onesignal.com cc'ing another team member and ask for your recovery keys.. If you have no other team member, be ready to provide details about your account for verification.
2. After verification, OneSignal will provide you new codes. You can then login again.
3. Disable 2-Step authentication and enable again to generate a new QR code.

##What if I am locked out and my organization enabled 2-step auth?

1. Contact an Organization Admin (if you are not) and ask them to login to onesignal.com (should have to use a 2-Step auth recovery code).
2. Ask Org Admin to go to Organization > Roles and disable 2-step auth for organization. Will enable again after you have reset your account. Everyone that has logged in at some point will still have 2 factor requirement.
3. Once you can login, go to your **Accounts and API keys** on top right menu button (your icon).
4. Enable 2-step authentication at your personal level (may need to disable and enable).
5. You will get prompted to scan the QR code again.
﻿6. Ask your Organization Admin (if you are not) to re-enable 2-step authentication again for the entire organization back to Organization > Roles.

##What if I don’t remember my login password?
The process to reset your forgotten password is still the [same](doc:manage-your-onesignal-account#reset-onesignal-account-password).

##What if I don’t remember recovery codes?
Please contact OneSignal Support to unlock your account. Please generate a new set of recovery codes on successful login and keep them safe.

## How do I disable Two-Step Authentication?
Access Two-Step Authentication settings on the OneSignal Account Management page. Click on “Disable”. 
*Note*: Users will not be able to disable Two-Step Authentication if any of the organizations they are part of enforces it.

## How do I generate new recovery codes?
Access Two-Step Authentication settings on the OneSignal Account Management page.
Click on “Generate New Recovery Codes”.

## OAuth Login
Customers using third-party OAuth login methods (Facebook, Google, Github, etc) can enable Two-Step Authentication on Onesignal following the [same process](doc:2-step-authentication#how-to-set-up-two-step-authentication-on-onesignal).

## Supported Authenticator Apps
We recommend using Authy, but any authenticator app that supports a Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) mechanism, including Google authenticator, Microsoft authenticator, etc. can be used to set up Two-Step Authentication on OneSignal.
