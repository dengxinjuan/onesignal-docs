## How am I charged?

**Growth and Professional Plans** have a fixed platform fee and variable subscriber fee. 
The **Enterprise Plan** is customized based on your requirements, best if over 150,000 subscribers.

For mobile push and web push, we charge based on subscribers, and you get unlimited volume of sends. For in-app, we charge based on impressions, since messages can be delivered to all app users regardless of whether they have subscribed.

-  **Subscribers**: Within your **Paid Organization** divide the Subscribed Users Count by 1000 and multiply by $3. 

- **Delivered In-App Messages**: If you are using In-App Messages (Mobile App Only Feature, not available for Websites), you can check your Impressions for the month, add them together. Divide by 1000 and multiply by $3.

### Can I cancel anytime?

Yes on **Growth and Pro plans** since they are month-to-month, no contract. You can downgrade to free anytime in the Dashboard > Organizations > Your Org > Billing > Options > Downgrade to Free

This will cancel your subscription with us and add you back to the free account.

**Enterprise Plans** are subject to terms of the contract.

### How do I upgrade my plan?
If you are interested in upgrading to the Growth Plan or Professional Plan, you can easily upgrade in your dashboard. Simply choose the appropriate organization and navigate to the Billing tab.

Yes and you should delete users as close to the start of the billing cycle as possible to not be charged for them. If you send messages to all devices for the cycle, then delete users midway or at the end of the cycle, you will still be charged based on your fair usage for that cycle. 

Please follow the [Delete Users Guide](doc:delete-users) for steps how to do this.
