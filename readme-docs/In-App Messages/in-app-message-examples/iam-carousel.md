Carousels can be extremely useful for any In-App Message. Here you can onboard users and create an onboarding flow, show and introduce new features, and much more. 

For a Carousel effect, you can add up to 10 cards per screen. Each card can have any combination of customizable Blocks. Cards are currently only supported in the Full Message Type and require a Paid Plan.

**Add Card** to add more cards and swipe the IAM Demo screen to view the card like a real device!
