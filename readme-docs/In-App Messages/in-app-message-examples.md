##Create A Survey

Ask your users questions and segment them based on their answers!

See [Example: Create A Survey](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/example-create-a-survey).

##Target Certain Android Manufacturers and Devices

Some Android device manufacturers will force quit your app when it gets swiped away. This prevents users from getting push. This message will help detect those type of device manufacturers and let your users know how to get push at all times.

See [Example: Target Certain Android Manufacturers and Devices](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/example-target-certain-android-manufacturers-and-devices).
