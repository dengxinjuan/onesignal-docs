Push Notifications are "Rich Text" Format messages that get "pushed" from the FCM/APNS/WNS servers to your subscribers. Devices subscribe or "opt-in" to receive push notifications usually through [Prompting](doc:permission-requests) like on Web Browsers or iOS Mobile Apps. Android Mobile App subscriptions occur as soon as the device downloads and opens the app.

Here are common layout guides to follow for push notifications across all platforms:
[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-0": "Notification Content",
    "h-1": "Details",
    "0-0": "[Character Limits](#character-limits)",
    "0-1": "How many characters are allowed and recommended per platform.\n[Emoji](#emojis) support is available across all platforms üëç",
    "1-0": "[Images](doc:web-push-notification-icons#image)",
    "1-1": "Large Images that appear with the notification. Supported by Chrome on Windows, macOS, and Android.",

    "3-0": "Sounds",
    "3-1": "Not customizable on Web Push.",
    "4-0": "[Web Push badges](doc:web-push-notification-icons#badge)",
    "4-1": "Small icons on Chrome for Android that appear in top Notification Center when push is received.",

    "5-1": "Custom buttons that can support different actions or links."
  },

You can also control some aspects of the [Notification's Behavior & Payload](doc:how-notifications-work) such as how long the push will be held by FCM when the device is offline, collapsing, and persisting notifications.
[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-0": "Notification Behavior",
    "h-1": "Details",
    "0-0": "[Linking](doc:links)",
    "0-1": "When clicked, send users to a custom url.",
    "1-0": "[Time To Live](doc:how-notifications-work#time-to-live)",
    "1-1": "How long the push is saved on the FCM/APNS/WNS servers if the user's device is offline.",
    "2-0": "[Notification Collapsing](doc:how-notifications-work#notification-collapsing)",

# Character limits

Because each platform uses a different visual layout for messages, the amount of content that is visible varies. For mobile apps, see the [Mobile Push Notifications Guide](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/mobile-push-notifications-guide).

The following are approximations for how many characters in a notification based on platform. 

[Emojis](https://getemoji.com/) count as a single character. Simply copy-paste the emoji you want into the message or title. Some limitations on Windows 7 and older Operating Systems.
[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-1": "Title",
    "0-0": "Windows: Chrome",
    "h-2": "Body",
    "0-1": "~60 (Chrome 68+)\n~40 (Chrome 67 and lower)",
    "1-0": "Windows: Firefox",
    "2-0": "Mac: Chrome, Firefox, Safari",
    "1-1": "~40",
    "2-1": "~20-40",
    "0-2": "~120 (Chrome 68+)\n~0 - 150 (Chrome 67 and lower)",
    "1-2": "~140-190",
    "2-2": "~20-80",
    "3-0": "**Best Fit Across All Platforms**\n(Including Mobile Apps)",
    "3-1": "~20",
    "3-2": "~60",
    "h-0": "Platform"
  },
  "cols": 3,
  "rows": 4
}
[/block]
## Windows

**Chrome 68+** do not have any restrictions with images added and show about the same title (~60 characters on screen and ~60-80 in Notification Center) and body (~126 characters on screen and ~120-160) count.

        1561,
        "#948980"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
## Firefox
Titles support ~40 characters, and bodies support ~140-190 characters:

        "#2a2b2c"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
## macOS

All mac browsers (except Safari) have the same limits due to the way macOS treats notifications. The features a notification is sent with (such as Icons and Notification Persistence) affect the amount of characters visible:
[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-1": "Title",
    "h-2": "Body",
    "0-0": "Default",
    "2-0": "With `persistNotification`",
    "4-0": "Notification Center Default",
    "0-1": "~40",
    "0-2": "~44",
    "2-1": "~30",
    "2-2": "~33",
    "4-1": "~39",
    "4-2": "~80",
    "h-0": "",
    "1-0": "With Icon",
    "1-1": "~32",
    "1-2": "~35",
    "3-0": "With `persistNotification` + Icon",
    "3-1": "~21",
    "3-2": "~24",
    "5-0": "Notification Center + Icon",
    "5-1": "~30",
    "5-2": "~62"
  },
  "cols": 3,
  "rows": 6
}

##Safari
There is not a way to remove or edit the site icon on Safari without changing the default icon set in your OneSignal Dashboard.
[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-1": "Title",
    "h-2": "Body",
    "0-1": "~40",
    "0-2": "~90",
    "0-0": "Default"
  },

      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
## Emojis

You can copy and paste emojis directly into the Title and Message of the notification.
Any standard emoji will work and you can use http://getemoji.com/ for more.
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "warning",
  "title": "Emoji Limitations",
  "body": "Emojis are controlled by the operating system that is receiving the notification and must support the emoji for it to be seen."
}
[/block]
##Site URL
The websites URL cannot change on the push, it must always show the site origin the user subscribed under.

#Additional data
Additional content that is not visible may accompany a message payload. Each platform has different limits and is based on the body, title, and any images or custom data you add. 

**This is roughly `3500` characters for both Android and iOS.**

#FAQ

## Can OneSignal send Push Notifications in an On-Premise Closed network?

This can work as long as the computers on your closed network have access to the push gateway servers that you  want to support:
- https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203609
- https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options#messaging-ports-and-your-firewall

If the network is completely disconnected from the Internet, push notifications cannot be delivered via the standard OS/browser services, which is what we support.
