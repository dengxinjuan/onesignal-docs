**Invalid Google Credentials** is thrown when your Google Server API Key is entered incorrectly. This error can also happen to keys that were generated using the Google Cloud Console due to a bug with Google's systems. 

## Steps to Resolve

Follow this guide to generate a new Server API Key: https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/generate-a-google-server-api-key.

**Make sure you are generating an API key for the correct Google Project.**

Contact support with your correct Google Server API key, GCM/FCM number, and APP ID to verify your account.
