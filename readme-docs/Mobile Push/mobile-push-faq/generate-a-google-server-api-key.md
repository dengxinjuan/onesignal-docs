A Google Firebase Server Key is required for all **Android** mobile apps and **Chrome app extensions**. It is optional for **Amazon** apps.

### What is a Firebase Server Key?

A Firebase Server Key and Firebase Sender ID are required in order to send push notifications to Android mobile app devices.

The goal of this section is to provision your Firebase Server Key and Firebase Sender ID for use in OneSignal.

# Requirements

- An Android mobile app, Chrome app or extension, or an Amazon app.
- A [Firebase account](https://firebase.google.com/)
- A [OneSignal Account](https://onesignal.com/), if you do not already have one.

# Step 1. Create A Firebase Project

Push Notifications require a Firebase Project. If you don't have one setup yet, click **Add project** and follow the directions to setup your project.

If you already have an FCM project, skip to Step 2.

# FAQ

## Can I use the same Firebase Keys for multiple apps?

Yes, you can use the same Sender ID and Firebase Server API key for multiple apps created in OneSignal. If you plan to export this data or sell the app or use [Google Analytics for Firebase](doc:google-analytics-for-firebase) you should create unique Firebase Projects in these cases.

## How can I change my Firebase Keys if I have over 100 users?

If possible, never change these keys. If you did change or accidentally deleted your Firebase project, you must contact support@onesignal.com with the OneSignal App ID, new FCM Sender ID and new FCM Server API key for us to update it.
