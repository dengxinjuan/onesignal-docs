Push Notifications are "Rich Text" Format messages that get "pushed" from the FCM/APNS/WNS servers to your subscribers. Devices subscribe or "opt-in" to receive push notifications usually through a prompt on iOS Mobile Apps. Android Mobile App subscriptions occur as soon as the device downloads and opens the app.

Here are common layout guides to follow for push notifications across all platforms:
[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-0": "Notification Content",
    "h-1": "Details",
    "0-0": "[Character Limits](#content)",
    "0-1": "How many characters are allowed and recommended per platform.\n[Emoji](#emojis) support is available across all platforms üëç",

You can also control some aspects of the [Notification's Behavior & Payload](doc:how-notifications-work) such as how long the push will be held by FCM/APNS when the device is offline, collapsing notifications

  "data": {
    "h-0": "Notification Behavior",
    "h-1": "Details",
    "0-0": "[Deep-links and URLs](doc:links)",

# Content
Because each platform uses a different visual layout for messages, the amount of content that is visible varies. For websites, see [Web Push Notifications Guide](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/push-notification-guide).

## Character limits
The following are approximations for how many characters in a notification based on platform. 

[Emojis](https://getemoji.com/) count as a single character. Simply copy-paste the emoji you want into the message or title.
[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-1": "Title",
    "0-1": "~25-50 (same for Subtitle)",
    "h-2": "Body",
    "0-0": "iOS",
    "1-0": "Android",
    "1-1": "~50",
    "0-2": "~150",
    "1-2": "~150",
    "2-0": "**Best Fit Across All Platforms**\n(Including Web)",
    "2-1": "~20",
    "2-2": "~60",
    "h-0": "Platform"
  },
  "cols": 3,
  "rows": 3
}
[/block]
## Additional data
Additional content that is not visible may accompany a message payload. Each platform has different limits and is based on the body, title, and any images or custom data you add. 

**This is roughly `3500` characters for both Android and iOS.**

## Emojis

You can copy and paste emojis directly into the Title, Subtitle, and Message of the notification.
Any standard emoji will work and you can use http://getemoji.com/ for more.
