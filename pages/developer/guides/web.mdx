# Step 1. Choose Integration

If you plan to add OneSignal to your site using code, continue with **Typical Site** setup or select [Custom Code Setup](doc:web-push-custom-code-setup).

If you use our [WordPress Plugin](doc:wordpress), [Shopify App](doc:shopify) or a custom Website Builder, see our [Website Builder Options]().

## Website Builder Options

OneSignal provides easy integration with the following 3rd party website builders:

| Official Plugins | Common Integrations |   |   |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | - | - |
| [WordPress Guide](doc:wordpress) | [Blogger Setup](doc:blogger) | [Bubble Setup](doc:bubble) | [Webflow Setup](doc:webflow-setup) |
| [Shopify App Guide](doc:shopify) | [Squarespace Setup](doc:squarespace) | [Magento Setup](doc:magento-setup) | |
| | [Drupal Setup](doc:drupal) | [Joomla Setup](doc:joomla-setup) | |
| | [Wix Setup](doc:wix) | [Weebly Setup](doc:weebly) | |

# Step 2. Site Setup

Input your default site information.
<Image src="/images/Web Guide/Site Setup.png" alt="Web4" width={1379} height={1019} />

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| SITE NAME | The default name to call your site used in push notifications. |
| SITE URL | Your website URL including:<br/>- `http://` or `https://`<br/>- `www` or non-www links (e.g. `https://example.com`, `https://www.example.com`)<br/><br/>Trying to test locally, see [Local Testing Setup](doc:web-push-options#local-testing) |
| AUTO RESUBSCRIBE (HTTPS ONLY) | **Recommended:** Allows push subscribers to automatically resubscribe upon returning to your site without being prompted if they clear their browser data or if you are transferring to OneSignal from another push provider. |
| DEFAULT ICON URL | Icon used for the [Slide Prompt](doc:slide-prompt) and default for push notifications.<br/><br/>Enter an `https` icon URL or upload file that is square `256x256` pixels.<br/><br/>The file must be `.png`, `.jpg`, or `.gif`. |

## My site is not fully HTTPS

Select this checkbox if any apply:
- you have an `HTTP`  website
- you cannot upload files to your web host's servers
- your site is hosted by WordPress.com or HubSpot COS

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| CHOOSE A LABEL | The subdomain label used for push subscription.<br/><br/>Set this to be something similar to your current domain.<br/><br/>See [Web Push HTTP vs. HTTPS](doc:web-push-http-vs-https) for more details. |

# Step 3. Permission Prompt Setup

By default, the [Push Slide Prompt](doc:slide-prompt) will show on the first page view after 10 seconds. You can skip this step for now and come back later to add new prompts or modify this one. See our [Web Prompting Guide](doc:permission-requests) for more details.

## Multiple Service Workers
If you are using or plan to use another service worker on your site, please follow the [OneSignal Service Worker Setup Guide](doc:onesignal-service-worker-faq).

## Safari - Custom Certificate (Optional)
OneSignal automatically provides the necessary certificates to work with Safari Browsers at no additional cost. If you already have your own Safari Web Push Certificates, toggle on this option to upload your `Safari Web .p12 Push Certificate` and password.

# Step 4. Upload Files

Next, you'll need to add the OneSignal SDK Service Worker file to your site.

### Option 1 - Create file and copy code

1. Create a new file `OneSignalSDKWorker.js` at the top-level root of your site (public).

2. Copy the following import statement: `importScripts('https://cdn.onesignal.com/sdks/OneSignalSDKWorker.js');`

### Option 2 - Download zip folder and upload

1. Click Download OneSignal SDK files. (You can also [download the file here](https://github.com/OneSignal/OneSignal-Website-SDK/files/7585231/OneSignal-Web-SDK-HTTPS-Integration-Files.zip)). 

2. Unzip the download. There should be a single file you need to host:
  - `https://yoursite.com/OneSignalSDKWorker.js`

### Hosting the file

The OneSignal SDK files must be publicly accessible and can be placed at the top-level root of your site. **Note:** If you want to place them in a subfolder you can! Please see our [OneSignal Service Worker Guide](doc:onesignal-service-worker-faq) for instructions.

### Note regarding Service Worker file(s)
If you are revisiting this page for an existing site set up prior to November 22, 2021, and are currently using two service worker files:
   - `OneSignalSDKWorker.js`
   - `OneSignalSDKUpdaterWorker.js`

you **should** continue hosting both files. This is to prevent the Service Worker from going stale if a user doesn't return to your site in some time.

On November 22, 2021 the OneSignal Web SDK was updated to require only a single service worker file. New setups will now only require a single file.

# Step 5. Add Code to Site

To enable OneSignal on your site, you will need to paste the provided code into your website's `<head>`. If you do not have access to modify your site's code, you will need to contact a developer to help you.
