# Glossary

### Summary

  We have users with varying degrees of awareness of messaging and how to re-engage our users. Many of our competitors have glossaries to explain the terminology used in documentation and create a consistent understanding.

 Additionally, as we are now moving to become an omnichannel provider as opposed to focusing on push, we now aim to increase our existing users understanding of newer, companion-based channels.

 Here we propose to add a glossary into OneSignal. Initially, it will live inside our documentation but has the potential to be used in our CMS in order to create engagement and drive visitors into our site. Hence allowing us to position ourselves as an omnichannel provider.
 
###Terminology

Here we collate common terms used in OneSignal and across our channels.

| A/B Testing   | A/B Testing allows you to test two or more variations of a message, for the purpose of identifying which message variation solicits the best response from its recipients. A/B testing is primarily used to improve the click-through or open rate of your messages.    |
