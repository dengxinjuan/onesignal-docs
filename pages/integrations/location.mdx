# Locations

## Radar

- Geofences: More powerful than native geofencing, with unlimited geofences, polygon geofences, and more.
- Places: Detect when a user visits a place, chain, or category without creating geofences for those places
- Insights: Predict a user's home and work locations and detect when a user is at home, at work, or traveling
- Regions: Detect a user's country, state, DMA, and postal code. Simpler than reverse geocoding.
